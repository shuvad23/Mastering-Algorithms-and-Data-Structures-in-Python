On a higher level, DFS excels in problems related to the establishment of connections within graphs and the discovery of pathways between two nodes. In terms of time efficiency, DFS thrives on densely connected graphs where the probability of finding the target quickly exceeds that of BFS.\n",

        ">However, all tools have their limitations and nuances. DFS does not perform optimally in problems necessitating the shortest path, such as GPS routing problems, where BFS is a superior choice. Additionally, DFS requires careful management when dealing with cycles within the graph, as it could end up in an infinite loop without effective control over the visited nodes.\n",

Envision a scenario where you are an explorer venturing through a mythical jungle in search of sacred artifacts scattered across a complex network of trails filled with obstacles and rewards. To ensure a unique route is chosen each time, the game could employ DFS to steer your game character through the virtual jungle.\n",

        ">DFS can also be deployed for pathfinding. Suppose we have a maze represented as a graph, and the goal is to find a path from one corner to another. The DFS algorithm would enable exploration of paths, selecting a path, and following it to the farthest point until a dead-end is reached before reverting and attempting the next available path until the destination is reached. Each move marks the node as visited and the path taken is retained.\n",
        "\n",
        ">However, while DFS can help locate a path, it does not guarantee the most efficient or shortest path. In scenarios requiring the shortest path, we would utilize another algorithm, like BFS or Dijkstra's algorithm."

While this strategy might sound like it solves the problem, in reality, it can be very inefficient, especially when the number of nodes and edges is large. Storing all possible paths could lead to overflowing memory and sluggish time complexity. In fact, the time complexity for this algorithm is exponential, meaning it wouldn't perform well for even medium-sized graphs.\n",

All starting vertex's neighbors will be processed at depth 1, and the minimal distance to them is also 1. Continuing the pattern, when BFS processes the vertex at depth d, we can be sure the minimal distance to this vertex is d. As BFS doesn't visit the same vertex twice, we will eventually visit all vertices and set a minimal distance for each of them."
